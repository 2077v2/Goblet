- Perform a Cleanup.  Video [HERE](https://youtu.be/RT7w9LDec1I)  

## [I've installed the collection but my game crashes when I create a character](https://)❓

- This is most likely because you have two or more non-compatible mods enabled ie **MAKEUP**, **CUSTOM PLAYER FACES**, **WANDS** check the mod settings and overview section.

## [My game is crashing ❓ ](https://) 

- If you are crashing or items are not working properly this is because you have 2 conflicting mods.  At this stage, there is no way to fix this due to the way the files work in the game. To fix these issues you need to determine which mods are affected and then uninstall one of them.

## [Cleanup](https://) *(recommended after each update)*

3) Once in your mod folder, we want to open up Vortex at the top on the mods tab you will see "purge mods" select this.

4) Now, look back in the mods folder again all of the mods should have been removed if there are any left behind select them and delete them.

This is a complete overhaul of Hogwarts Legacy to go with my mod collection THE GOBLET
This mod came about for a few reasons. But the main reason was a lot of the game balancing mods available affect the same file so you can't have more than two mods at one time without using the mod merger to merge them and this can sometimes be a headache. The Goblet Overhaul makes it easier with an easy-to-install mod menu and many presets for you to choose from. This is still a work in progress and a lot of testing has to be done feedback is appreciated and if you would like to join our Discord and become a tester for my mods and collections let me know.
